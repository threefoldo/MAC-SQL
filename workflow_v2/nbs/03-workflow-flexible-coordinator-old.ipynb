    "# Flexible Coordinator Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a flexible text-to-SQL workflow where the coordinator makes intelligent decisions about which agent to run based on the current state of the query tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-linear Execution**: Coordinator decides which agent to call based on node state\n",
    "2. **Automatic Node Management**: Current node is tracked in memory\n",
    "3. **State-based Decisions**: Coordinator examines what each node needs\n",
    "4. **Error Recovery**: Can retry specific steps without restarting\n",
    "5. **Complex Query Support**: Handles multi-node query trees intelligently\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinator examines the current node and decides:\n",
    "- No intent? → Run query_analyzer\n",
    "- No mapping? → Run schema_linker\n",
    "- No SQL? → Run sql_generator\n",
    "- No execution/evaluation? → Run sql_evaluator\n",
    "- Poor quality? → Retry the appropriate step\n",
    "- All good? → Check for workflow completion"

First, always check the logs to understand the current state:\n   - Look for \"current node\" mentions\n   - Check what components the node already has\n   - Check the quality of any evaluations\n\n2. Based on the current node's state, decide what to do:\n   - If no query tree exists → call query_analyzer with the user's query\n   - If node lacks mapping → call schema_linker with \"Link query to database schema\"  \n   - If node lacks SQL → call sql_generator with \"Generate SQL query\"\n   - If node lacks evaluation → call sql_evaluator with \"Analyze SQL execution results\"\n   - If evaluation quality is poor → analyze the issue and retry appropriate step\n\n3. After sql_evaluator runs:\n   - Check if it says \"workflow complete\" in the logs\n   - If workflow is complete → summarize the final answer and say \"TERMINATE\"\n   - If not complete → continue with the next node\n\n4. TERMINATION RULES:\n   - You MUST say \"TERMINATE\" at the end of your message when workflow is complete\n   - Look for \"workflow complete\" in the sql_evaluator logs\n   - When all nodes have good quality results, summarize and say \"TERMINATE\"\n   - Example: \"The highest rate is 75.0%. TERMINATE\"\n\n5. For poor quality results:\n   - Wrong tables? → retry schema_linker with guidance\n   - Bad SQL? → retry sql_generator with error details\n   - Missing data? → check if schema linking was complete\n\nCRITICAL: You must end your final answer with the word \"TERMINATE\" to end the conversation.\"\"\",\n    model_client=coordinator_client,\n    tools=[query_analyzer.get_tool(), schema_linker.get_tool(), \n           sql_generator.get_tool(), sql_evaluator.get_tool()]\n)\n\nprint(\"✓ Created flexible coordinator with termination rules\")"

    "Your agents:\n",
    "- query_analyzer: Analyzes queries and creates query trees\n",
    "- schema_linker: Links queries to database schema\n",
    "- sql_generator: Generates SQL from linked schema\n",
    "- sql_evaluator: Executes and evaluates SQL results\n",
    "\n",
    "DECISION PROCESS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, always check the logs to understand the current state:\n",
    "   - Look for \"current node\" mentions\n",
    "   - Check what components the node already has\n",
    "   - Check the quality of any evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Based on the current node's state, decide what to do:\n",
    "   - If no query tree exists → call query_analyzer\n",
    "   - If node lacks mapping → call schema_linker\n",
    "   - If node lacks SQL → call sql_generator\n",
    "   - If node lacks evaluation → call sql_evaluator\n",
    "   - If evaluation quality is poor → analyze the issue and retry appropriate step\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After sql_evaluator runs:\n",
    "   - Check if it says \"workflow complete\" → summarize and TERMINATE\n",
    "   - Check if it moved to a new node → examine that node's needs\n",
    "   - Check if quality was poor → decide how to fix it\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For poor quality results, consider:\n",
    "   - Wrong tables? → retry schema_linker with guidance\n",
    "   - Bad SQL? → retry sql_generator with error details\n",
    "   - Missing data? → check if schema linking was complete\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT:\n",
    "- Agents automatically work on the current node in memory\n",
    "- sql_evaluator manages node progression automatically\n",
    "- Only TERMINATE when you see \"workflow complete\"\n",
    "- Be smart about retries - understand what went wrong first\"\"\",\n",
