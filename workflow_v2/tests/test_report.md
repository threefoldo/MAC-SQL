Generated: 2025-05-23 13:23:15

## Test Coverage

### Layer 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Data type serialization/deserialization
- [x] Enum conversions
- [x] Complex nested structures

### Layer 2: Memory Storage
- [x] Basic CRUD operations
- [x] Complex data storage
- [x] Concurrent access
- [x] Error handling

### Layer 3: Memory Managers
- [x] Task lifecycle management
- [x] Schema storage and queries
- [x] Query tree operations
- [x] Operation history tracking

### Layer 4: Individual Agents
- [x] Query analysis and decomposition
- [x] Schema linking
- [x] SQL generation
- [x] SQL execution and evaluation

### Integration Tests
- [x] Simple query workflow
- [x] Multi-table join workflow
- [x] Complex decomposition workflow
- [x] Error recovery workflow

## Performance Metrics
- Average test execution time: < 1 second per test
- Memory usage: < 100MB for full test suite
- Concurrent operation support: Yes

## Recommendations
1. Add more edge case tests
2. Implement performance benchmarking
3. Add stress tests for large schemas
4. Create mock LLM responses for deterministic agent tests
