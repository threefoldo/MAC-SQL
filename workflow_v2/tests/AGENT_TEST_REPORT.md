# Comprehensive Agent Test Report

## Test Overview
All 4 agents in the workflow_v2 system were successfully tested with a sample database and queries.

## Test Environment
- **Database**: Test database with 2 tables (employees, departments)
- **LLM Model**: gpt-4o-mini
- **Test Cases**: 2 different queries with varying complexity

## Agent Test Results

### ✅ 1. QueryAnalyzerAgent
**Purpose**: Analyzes queries and creates query trees

**Test Case 1**: "What is the average salary of employees in the Engineering department?"
- Successfully analyzed the query
- Correctly identified intent: "Calculate the average salary of employees who work in the Engineering department"
- Classified complexity as: SIMPLE
- Created root node: `node_1748319063.545632_root`
- Used evidence: "Department names are stored in the 'department' column of employees table"

**Test Case 2**: "List the top 2 highest paid employees with their salaries"
- Successfully analyzed the query
- Correctly identified intent: "Retrieve the names and salaries of the top 2 highest paid employees"
- Classified complexity as: SIMPLE
- Created root node: `node_1748319142.762325_root`

### ✅ 2. SchemaLinkerAgent
**Purpose**: Links database schema to query nodes

**Test Case 1**:
- Successfully linked schema to node
- Identified required table: `employees`
- Mapped columns: `salary`, `department`
- Correctly assigned table alias: `e`

**Test Case 2**:
- Successfully linked schema to node
- Identified required table: `employees`
- Mapped columns: `name`, `salary`
- Added proper ordering requirements

### ✅ 3. SQLGeneratorAgent
**Purpose**: Generates SQL from linked schema

**Test Case 1**:
- Generated SQL: `SELECT AVG(e.salary) AS average_salary FROM employees AS e WHERE e.department = 'Engineering'`
- Query type: AGGREGATE
- Correctly used table alias
- Applied filter for Engineering department

**Test Case 2**:
- Generated SQL: `SELECT e.name, e.salary FROM employees AS e ORDER BY e.salary DESC LIMIT 2`
- Query type: SIMPLE
- Correctly ordered by salary descending
- Applied LIMIT 2 for top results

### ✅ 4. SQLEvaluatorAgent
**Purpose**: Evaluates SQL execution results

**Test Case 1**:
- Execution result: 1 row with average_salary = 85000.0
- Evaluation:
  - Answers intent: YES
  - Result quality: EXCELLENT
  - Confidence: 1.0
  - Summary: "The result accurately provides the average salary of employees in the Engineering department"

**Test Case 2**:
- Execution result: 2 rows (Bob Johnson: 95000, John Doe: 85000)
- Evaluation:
  - Answers intent: YES
  - Result quality: EXCELLENT
  - Confidence: 1.0
  - Summary: "The results accurately provide the names and salaries of the top 2 highest paid employees"

## Key Observations

### Strengths
1. **Consistent Pattern**: All agents follow the BaseMemoryAgent pattern with reader/parser callbacks
2. **Clear Separation**: Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility
3. **Memory Integration**: Agents effectively share state through KeyValueMemory
4. **Error Handling**: Agents include proper error handling and logging
5. **Context Awareness**: Agents use evidence and previous results effectively

### Technical Details
- All agents properly implement `_reader_callback` to read context from memory
- All agents properly implement `_parser_callback` to update memory with results
- Agents are wrapped in MemoryAgentTool for seamless integration
- The workflow maintains state across agent calls through shared memory

### SQL Generation Quality
- SQL queries are syntactically correct
- Proper use of table aliases
- Constraints from prompts.py are applied (e.g., selecting only needed columns)
- Appropriate use of aggregate functions and ordering

## Conclusion

All 4 agents passed their tests successfully:
- ✅ QueryAnalyzerAgent correctly analyzes and decomposes queries
- ✅ SchemaLinkerAgent properly links schema elements to query nodes
- ✅ SQLGeneratorAgent generates correct and optimized SQL
- ✅ SQLEvaluatorAgent accurately evaluates execution results

The agents work together seamlessly through the shared memory system, demonstrating a well-architected text-to-SQL conversion pipeline.
