- Ensures proper structure even with empty content

✅ **test_sql_validation** - SQL validation functionality
- Tests validation of generated SQL against schema mapping
- Validates that all mapped tables appear in SQL
- Ensures basic SQL syntax requirements (SELECT/WITH)

✅ **test_sql_validation_missing_table** - Validation error detection
- Tests detection of missing mapped tables in SQL
- Validates validation failure for incomplete SQL
- Ensures validation issues are properly reported

## Database Schemas Used

### Financial Database (BIRD Dataset)
- **clients** - Client demographics and district references
- **accounts** - Account information with district links
- **loans** - Loan records with amounts, dates, and status
- **district** - Geographic and demographic data

### Schema Mapping Features Tested
- Table alias handling (`clients c`, `loans l`)
- Column usage classification (select/filter/join/aggregate/group)
- Join relationship specification
- Purpose documentation for tables and columns

## SQL Generation Patterns Tested

### Query Types Covered
1. **Simple SELECT** - Basic filtering and column selection
2. **Multi-table JOIN** - INNER JOINs across multiple tables
3. **Aggregation** - COUNT, AVG with GROUP BY
4. **Date Filtering** - YEAR() function and temporal conditions
5. **Complex CTE** - WITH clauses and subqueries
6. **Basic COUNT** - Simple aggregate operations

### SQL Features Validated
- Proper table aliasing
- Correct JOIN syntax (explicit JOIN vs comma-separated)
- WHERE clause generation for filters
- GROUP BY clause for aggregations
- ORDER BY for result sorting
- CDATA handling in XML responses
- SQL syntax validation

## Test Framework Features

### Mock Architecture
- **MockMemoryAgentTool** - Deterministic SQL generation responses
- Predefined XML responses for each SQL pattern
- No actual LLM API calls required
- Fast execution (< 0.2 seconds total)

### XML Response Parsing
- CDATA section handling for SQL content
- Explanation and query type extraction
- Component analysis (tables and operations)
- Error handling for malformed XML

### Schema Integration
- QueryNode creation with complete schema mappings
- TableMapping, ColumnMapping, and JoinMapping objects
- Schema XML formatting for agent input
- Tree manager initialization and node management

## Code Coverage

### Core Methods Tested
- `_parse_generation_xml()` - XML response parsing
- `_format_schema_mapping()` - Schema mapping XML generation
- `validate_sql()` - SQL validation against schema
- Query tree integration and node management

### Validation Points
- SQL syntax correctness (SELECT/WITH requirements)
- Table usage validation (all mapped tables present)
- XML structure parsing accuracy
- Error handling robustness

## Performance
- All tests execute in **< 0.2 seconds**
- No external dependencies (LLM calls mocked)
- Efficient schema setup and query tree management

## Real-World SQL Examples

### Simple Query
```sql
SELECT c.client_id, c.gender, c.birth_date, c.district_id 
FROM clients c 
WHERE c.gender = 'F'
```

### Multi-table JOIN
```sql
SELECT c.gender, l.loan_id, l.amount, l.date
FROM clients c
JOIN accounts a ON c.district_id = a.district_id
JOIN loans l ON a.account_id = l.account_id
```

### Aggregation with GROUP BY
```sql
SELECT d.A2 as district_name, COUNT(l.loan_id) as loan_count
FROM loans l
JOIN accounts a ON l.account_id = a.account_id
JOIN district d ON a.district_id = d.district_id
GROUP BY d.district_id, d.A2
ORDER BY loan_count DESC
```

### Complex CTE
```sql
WITH district_avg_loans AS (
    SELECT d.district_id, d.A2 as district_name, AVG(l.amount) as avg_loan_amount
    FROM district d
    JOIN accounts a ON d.district_id = a.district_id
    JOIN loans l ON a.account_id = l.account_id
    GROUP BY d.district_id, d.A2
),
overall_avg AS (
    SELECT AVG(amount) as overall_average FROM loans
)
SELECT c.client_id, c.gender, dal.district_name
FROM clients c
JOIN district_avg_loans dal ON c.district_id = dal.district_id
CROSS JOIN overall_avg oa
WHERE dal.avg_loan_amount > oa.overall_average
```
