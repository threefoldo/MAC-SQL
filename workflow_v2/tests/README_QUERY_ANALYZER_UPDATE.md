# Query Analyzer Agent Test Update Summary

## Overview
Updated test code for QueryAnalyzerAgent to work with the new architecture using KeyValueMemory and the renamed modules.

## Key Changes

### 1. Import Updates
- Changed from `src.memory` to `keyvalue_memory` 
- Changed from `src.memory_types` to `memory_content_types`
- Updated all imports to use the new module names
- Fixed Python path handling to properly add `src` directory

### 2. Test Structure Updates

#### New Test File: `test_query_analyzer_agent.py`
Created a comprehensive test file specifically for QueryAnalyzerAgent that:
- Uses mock implementations for AutoGen components (MockAssistantAgent, MockMemoryAgentTool)
- Tests simple queries, join queries, and complex query decomposition
- Verifies the query tree structure is created correctly
- Includes integration tests with real SchemaReader when data is available

#### Updated File: `test_query_analyzer_bird.py`
- Renamed class from `TestQueryAnalyzerBIRD` to `TestQueryTreeManagementBIRD`
- Focuses on testing the query tree management components directly
- Tests various BIRD dataset query patterns without the agent

### 3. Mock Implementation
Created mocks to test agent functionality without LLM calls:
- `MockAssistantAgent`: Returns predefined XML responses based on query patterns
- `MockMemoryAgentTool`: Simulates the memory tool behavior

### 4. Test Patterns

#### Simple Query Test
```python
# Tests queries like: "What is the highest eligible free rate..."
- Verifies simple complexity detection
- Checks single table mapping
- Confirms root node creation
```

#### Join Query Test
```python
# Tests queries requiring joins between tables
- Verifies multiple table detection
- Checks join requirement identification
- Confirms proper table mapping
```

#### Complex Query Test
```python
# Tests queries requiring decomposition
- Verifies complex query detection
- Checks subquery creation
- Validates combination strategy
- Confirms tree structure with multiple nodes
```

## Usage

Run the tests:
```bash
# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_query_analyzer_agent.py -v

# Run with real data (if BIRD dataset available)
pytest tests/test_query_analyzer_agent.py::TestQueryAnalyzerIntegration -v

# Run all query analysis tests
pytest tests/test_query_analyzer*.py -v
```

## Test Coverage

The updated tests cover:
1. Query complexity detection (simple vs complex)
2. Table and column identification
3. Query decomposition into subqueries
4. Tree structure creation and management
5. Integration with SchemaReader
6. Memory storage and retrieval
7. Agent callback functionality

## Notes

- Tests use monkeypatch to inject mocks, avoiding actual LLM calls
- Real data integration tests are skipped if BIRD dataset is not available
- All tests are async and use pytest-asyncio
- Mock responses are based on actual expected XML format from the agent
